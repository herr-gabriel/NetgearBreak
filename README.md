NetgearBreak
============

A Python-based tool to generate valid serial numbers for Netgear devices.


Usage:
- Run NetgearBreak.py
- Select # of attempts (sky is the limit here)
- Let it run 
- IF APPLICABLE: Allow access via Windows Firewall Popup for WebDriver
- When it's done, check the directory where you executed it for a .csv file containing any valid serials found during the test.

Why? 
Insecure serial algorithms = common target for exploitation (see DEFCON 20 presentation on social engineering)


DISCLAIMER: THIS IS STRICTLY A POC TOOL, PRESENTED IN GOOD FAITH.
